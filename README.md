# Neurobeats
A Beat Saber 'clone' made for the courses IDATT2505 - Extended Reality (XR) and IDATT2501 - Specialization Project.
A VR game with a special adaptation of Beat Saber, designed to serve as a rehabilitation tool for individuals with motor and visual impairments. While it draws inspiration from the entertainment industry, the game takes on a serious role, requiring features tailored to therapeutic use. Key enhancements include:

* Customizable Gameplay: Parameters such as the range of block positions, spawn frequency, speed, visual noise, and slice directions can be adjusted to suit individual needs.
* External Control: The game must support control via a tablet or PC, enabling therapists or health professionals to adjust gameplay dynamically.
* Data Recording: The game must record detailed statistics to track user progress and provide feedback.
* The project was developed in Godot, which was a requirement for the assignment.
